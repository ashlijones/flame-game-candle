                Welcome to Flame Game Candles! I use high quality 100% soy wax. I hand pour each and everyone of the
                candles
                and wax melts that I sell. I customize each candle and wax melt to what you want! I let you choose the
                tin,
                a scent and a wax color if you would like. I also offer some glitter to add to spice it up just a bit
                and
                put more of a wow factor to your customized wax. I want you to be able to get exactly what you want. I
                never
                mass produce candles because in my shop, the choice is yours.

            </p>
            <p>
                Why 100% soy wax? Is there a difference between the wax?
                To that I say yes... definitely yes!!!
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Soy wax is biodegradable and cleans up with plain old soap and water.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Soy wax has a lower melting point than paraffin wax(the store bought candles have this kind of wax)
                    and because of this, soy candles will burn slower or longer than paraffin candles.

                </li>

                <li>
                    Soy wax burns with zero petro soot, creating petro soot free candles. Paraffin candles burn with
                    petro-soot.

                </li>

                <li>
                    The Soy Wax is a natural moisturizer and is perfect for sealing in moisture a in your skin. So if
                    you spill some onto your skin just rub it in and you will be set.

                </li>

                <li>
                    Soy Wax is vegan.

                </li>

                <p>
                    I hand pour your custom orders, with love, in Salt Lake City, Utah. I started this love of candle
                    making in
                    January of 2021. I started because I thought that it would be a fun little hobby to have and because
                    of
                    people like you, it has grown to a much bigger, fun adventure. I am excited to share my passion and
                    love for
                    these candles and wax melts.

                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are in Northern Utah, I do hand deliver them to your doorstep. I also ship my wax to wherever
                    you are
                    located. Please let me know in the comments if you are local or need it to be shipped. Shipping and
                    handling
                    fees will be calculated at checkout.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I also have a Facebook and Instagram page as well. Please follow and tag your candles with me on
                    that. Thank
                    you!

                </p>

                <p>
